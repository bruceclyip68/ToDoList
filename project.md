# AI Chat Assistant with OpenRouter Integration

This project is a **Streamlit**-based AI chat application built with **Python** that integrates with **OpenRouter**'s API to provide real-time, streaming AI responses. The application features a simple yet powerful interface where users can input three key components: a system prompt (defining the AI's behavior and role), contextual information (providing background or relevant details), and their specific question. Built with **Pydantic** for robust data validation and schema management, the app sends these inputs to OpenRouter's API, which then streams back intelligent responses from various AI models including GPT-4, Claude, and other leading language models. The streaming response feature ensures users receive AI-generated content in real-time, creating an engaging and interactive experience. Additionally, **Langfuse** integration provides comprehensive logging, monitoring, and analytics capabilities for tracking conversation quality, response times, and user interactions, making it easy to monitor and improve the application's performance over time.
